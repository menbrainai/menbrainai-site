# Deepfake Horror: AI and Identity in Sci-Fi

## What Deepfakes Are and Why They’re Scary  
Deepfakes synthesize media that looks or sounds real. Horror arises when identity becomes editable. If a face is only a texture and a voice a string of data, trust erodes. The terror comes from a realization: our senses can lie.

## Deepfake Horror in Sci-Fi Films  
Movies experiment with characters doubting their own eyes. A hero might watch a perfect deepfake of themselves commit crimes. The audience shares the dread as every video or call becomes suspect. Sci-fi horror uses deepfakes to destabilize what “real” means.

## AI Identity Paranoia in Horror Stories  
In literature, protagonists question if loved ones were replaced by digital forgeries. Journals and chat logs become battlegrounds for truth. The paranoia of not knowing who or what to believe drives the narrative, echoing classic body-snatcher tropes in a high-tech guise.

## Social Consequences of Deepfake Technology  
These stories push beyond personal horror to societal breakdown. En masse, deepfakes erode public trust. Sci-fi horror shows communities in chaos—unable to agree on reality, mobbing innocents, or surrendering to authoritarian AI that promises to authenticate truth.

## Ethical Dimensions of Deepfake Horror  
Creators grapple with the morality of using someone’s likeness. Sci-fi horror often features characters facing the backlash of leaked deepfakes—marriages ruined, careers ended. The ethical questions (Who controls your image? What’s the punishment for synthetic fraud?) intensify the fear on screen and page.

## Conclusion: Identity in the Blender  
Deepfake horror scares by shaking our faith in identity. The subgenre’s sci-fi shifts fear from masks to methods. The tools write new silhouettes, but humans frame meaning.
